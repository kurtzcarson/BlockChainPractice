Basic cryptocurrency I created using various tutorials and information online to better understand the underlying framework of blockchain technology.

What I want to continue to explore...
- 1.) Other consensus mechanisms like proof of stake, proof of activity, proof of capacity, and proof of storage
- 2.) Implementing the chain as a linked list, instead of an array...
- 3.) Read more about other hashing functions other than SHA256 (maybe those I learn about in my cryptography research)
- 4.) Letting miners choose which transactions to process/mine into a block from pending transactions
- 5.) Having a specified number of transactions that can be put into a single block
- 6.) Implementing multiple miners at once
- 7.) Optimize implementation finding balance of public key
- 8.) Making more checks before adding the block to the chain
