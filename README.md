Project I have created to better understand the underlying framework of blockchain technology.

What I want to continue to explore...
- 1.) Other consensus mechanisms like proof of stake, proof of activity, proof of capacity, and proof of storage
- 2.) Implementing the chain as a linked list, instead of an array...
- 3.) Read more about other hashing functions other than SHA256 (maybe those I learn about in my cryptography research)
- 4.) Letting miners choose which transactions to process/mine into a block from pending transactions
- 5.) Make addresses public keys of someone's wallet
- 6.) Ensure given address has funds to make transaction
